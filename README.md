Usage Instructions
Press “Get Started!”

Spotify will ask for your permission for my app to view your history, make and edit playlists.
NOTE: Don’t worry, I as a developer can’t see anything from your account, only the fact that you used my app. The app can only edit a playlist that it just made.
Create New List: Select Blacklist if there are specific artists you want to disclude from your top list. Select Whitelist if you want only those artists. Then write down the artists one at a time. Create a title for your list, then press the button to finish up.
This will return you to a list of your lists. Click on the list to view more details, or delete to delete it.
When viewing the list, click Create Playlist and it will do just that, and give you a popup when it’s done. You can view the playlist on the spotify app and play it there. It takes less than 30 seconds to appear and be completely functional.
